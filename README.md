# **EMC**: **E**mbedding-based **M**atrix **C**orrection
The source code for the ECAI'2023 paper titled "**Highly-Efficient Robinson-Foulds Distance Estimation with Matrix Correction**".

## Introduction

This Github repository contains the implementation of our proposed *Embedding-based Matrix Correction* algorithm, designed to enhance the estimation of Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance matrices, especially when dealing with incomplete phylogenetic trees. The algorithm is built leveraging the Euclidean embeddable assumption of the distance matrix, ensuring a solid theoretical performance guarantee and showing better performance in distance denosing and tree clustering tasks.
